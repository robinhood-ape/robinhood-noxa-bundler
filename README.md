# NOXA Token Bundler

Multi-wallet launch bundler for [NOXA Fun](https://fun.noxa.eth.limo/) on **Robinhood Chain** (chain ID `4663`).

Launches a token via the NOXA Launch Factory, then buys from multiple wallets as fast as possible so you hold supply before public snipers.

## Setup

```bash
cd bundler
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# set PRIVATE_KEY and token fields
```

## Commands

```bash
# Generate bundle wallets (prints keys — store securely)
npm run wallets

# Launch only (creator initial buy in the launch tx)
npm run launch

# Full bundle: fund wallets → launch → multi-wallet buys
npm run bundle
```

Keep `DRY_RUN=true` until you are ready to spend real ETH.

## How it works

1. **Launch** — calls `launchToken` on the NOXA factory with metadata + salt  
   - `msg.value = INITIAL_BUY_ETH + 0.0005 ETH` (flat launch fee)  
   - Creator buy is included in the same launch transaction
2. **Fund** — master wallet sends each bundle wallet `BUY_AMOUNT_ETH + GAS_RESERVE_ETH`
3. **Bundle buys** — each wallet wraps ETH → approves SwapRouter02 → `exactInputSingle` into the new Uniswap V3 pool

Same-block external buys may be restricted by NOXA (`LaunchBlockBuyBlocked`). This bundler fires buys immediately after the launch receipt; on Orbit L2 that is typically the next sequencer batch.

## Notes

- UI: [https://fun.noxa.eth.limo/](https://fun.noxa.eth.limo/) — new launches may still be disabled on NOXA Lite; on-chain `launchToken` will revert if paused.
- Never commit `.env` or generated private keys.
- Memecoins are high risk.
